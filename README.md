Rewrite of ApeESC to work with TypeScript
Original work here https://github.com/fritzy/ape-ecs

This software will hopefully be a complete rewrite of ApeESC created by Fritzy made to work better with TypeScript

This is setup to use node, express, and pixi for viewing, but all of those will be decoupled from the core ape-esc framework
